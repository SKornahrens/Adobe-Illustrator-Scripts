Scripts written to automate tedious functions for the Art Team. FATALITY v3 is current

"Specify Master" written by Adam Dehaven. Modified by Steve K for SG use. See module folder "Specify Master" for source code.

Full Script > Fatality is the most important to the Art Team. Its a combination of multiple modules to complete multiple tasks all at once. The modules were tests for each piece to double check functionality before they were combined.

Fatality v3 script does the following when executed: 
1. Finds and selects all magenta Die Lines found in current document
2. Creates art boards for every selected Die Line at their geometric bound in order of Die Line placement 
3. Measures the die line height and width, applies labels for height and width to the hundredth decimal place value
4. Prompts the user for Folder/File name  
5. Searches the StickerGiant server (/Volumes/ShrData/server_docs/custom_stickers/Art For Robb) for a folder matching step4 user input
6a. If no folder exists creates a folder based on step4 user input
6b. If folder exists matching step4 user input script will use the found folder to save revisions
7a. If 6a, creates a .pdf file with step4 user input (Example: steve.pdf)
7b. If 6b, creates a .pdf file with step4 user input + 2 (Example: steve2.pdf) (incrementally increases by 1 per 5,7 loop) 
8. Outlines all text found in document, including dimension labels
9a. If 6a, creates a .ai file with step4 user input (Example: steve.ai)
9b. If 6b, creates a .ai file with step4 user input + 2 (Example: steve2.ai) (incrementally increases by 1 per 5,9 loop)
